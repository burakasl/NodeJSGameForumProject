# Movie Forum API â€“ Node.js Learning Project

This is a backend-only learning project built to understand the basics of Node.js and Express. It features a simple API that handles user authentication and provides the core structure for CRUD operations.

The goal is to simulate the backend of a movie discussion forum, where users can register, create posts, comment on content, and manage personalized movie lists.

While not production-ready, this project serves as a practical sandbox for applying what I'm learning in real time.

## Learning Objectives

-   Getting familiar with the Express framework
-   Building RESTful API endpoints
-   Integrating PostgreSQL using Prisma ORM
-   Handling user authentication with JWT and bcrypt
-   Creating a maintainable API structure and route handling
-   Grasping the basics of middleware in Express
